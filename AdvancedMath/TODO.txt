TODO:

Equation:
- GetScope
  * Find all variables within a Token, recursively
  * Add method to Token class
- Solve
  * THIS METHOD OF SOLVING MAY BE FAULTY
  * Look at scope
  * One at a time until one variable left...
    ~ Isolate the variable
    ~ Substitute it in
  * Solve for that variable
  * Go back to equation, evaluate in values
  * If left side == right side in value, then the values are correct, return scope
  * If not... uhh....
